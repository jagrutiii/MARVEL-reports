## LTspice and KIcad
  *The objective of this task was to figure out how simulation software works and is advantageous. I learnt basic features and got familiar with its user interface as i designed a multivibrator in astable mode using a 555 IC.

  ## Task 6: Temparature Detection
  I used LM35 temparature sensor.I learnt how ot works. it produces analog output voltage that increases by 10mV for every rise in centigrade.

  ## Task 12: Solar panel
 the objective of this task was to understand the working principle of a solar panel. Semiconductor diodes were used in forward biased condition and connected parallely and checked for voltage produced across the setup.

## Task 16: Automatic door opener system.
PIR sensor which is used in this task works on the principle of Passive infrared detection. it uses a fresnel lens that focuses IR energy onto the sensor.It basically detects heat and a trigger is generated.Arduino is connected to the sensor and helps in the rotation of the servo motor according to the signal generated by the PIR sensor.

## Task 2&3:Speed and direction control o DC motor.
I learnt to control the speed of the dc motor using L298D motor driver and a potentiometer.
